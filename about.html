        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>My name is Marc Jamil Abraham. I was born in Redwood City, California and grew up there until moving to oregon for college at 17. I have been consistently involved in musical communities in every city I have lived in, but I have found that Eugene has a lot of very special artists and musicians residing in it.</p>
        <p>I have had the privilege to receive piano lessons from a young age, due to my mother's willingness to push me to enjoy something I was personally invested in. I find that everybody who is interested even remotely in playing an instrument has nothing to wait for, and should just pick one up and try. The only thing holding us back from enjoying the things we want to enjoy in life is ourselves, and you will never be able to pick up a new skill unless you accept that part of the learning process is knowing that learning something new does not mean you are bad at it. Pat yourself on the back for every small step and achievement you make and it will lead to personal greatness and self fulfillment. That is what I seek to teach here at my piano academy.</p>
